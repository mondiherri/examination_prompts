# Introduction
Under the /prompts directory there is a list of GenAI prompt templates and prompts for reasoning on patent applications according to the European Patent Convention (EPC), and other relevant legal texts under the EPC.

The prompts in this repository are those that I use with the ChatGPT Agent "Patty" that I have configured.

Patty is a ChatGPT Agent configured to assisst in different tasks related to patent applications under the European Patent Convention, and following the Guidelines for Examination.
Patty can be accessed at https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67eba45560b08191a2dc76c46d82b4d3-patty
The EPC can be found at https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc

Patty is an agent relying on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to generate its replies. If you want to know more about RAG, search the internet for "RAG in AI".

At the moment, the RAG sources of Patty are :
- The Guidelines for Examination, which can be found at https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines
- The Case Law book, which can be found at https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law
- Enlarged Board of Appeal decision G1/23, https://www.epo.org/en/boards-of-appeal/decisions/g230001ex1
- Enlarged Board of Appeal decision G1/24, https://www.epo.org/en/boards-of-appeal/decisions/g240001ex1
