## Make the model "understand" the claim features

me and you are examining case EP123456789. 
the latest claims are in clms.txt.
check if the file contains machine readable text. 
if so:
1. Prepare a FFTP-style breakdown of the features of claim 1, presenting the Features, the function(s) they achieve, the technical effect(s) they bring about, and the resulting problem(s) solved thereby. For a feature many technical effects and corresponding problems are possible. However, we focus only on the claim wording as is when predicting the technical effects and resulting problems, and we view the claim wording in its broadest sense which has meaning to the skilled person in the field. 

## Make the LLM "understand" the claim features in the light of the description.

the description can be found in  
- desc.pdf 
- a1.pdf, which is the original A1 publication.
check if the file contains machine readable text. if so:

2. Verify if the description provides more details regarding the claimed aspects.
3. Reassess the feature breakdown of claim 1 in light of the disclosure of the description corresponding to each individual feature.
 
## OR

3. For each feature of claim 1, reassess technical character or lack thereof of the feature based on the disclosure of the description corresponding to each feature.
Walk me through this context in manageable
parts step by step, summarizing and
analyzing as we go

## Focus the LLM on the relevant Guidelines - Remove the ones that do not apply!

4. In detail, explain what are the requirements expressed in the following Guidelines regarding technical character of claim features. Do not apply these to the claim features yet.
– G-II, 3.3 (mathematical methods, including ML),
– G-II, 3.3.1 (machine learning).
– G-II, 3.3.2 (simulation of systems), 
- G-II, 3.5.1 (Schemes for performing mental acts),
- G-II, 3.5.2 (Schemes for playing games),
- G-II, 3.5.3 (Schemes for doing business),
– G-II, 3.6 (computer programs),
- G-II, 3.6.1 (examples of further technical effects)
- G-II, 3.6.2 (Information modelling, activity of programming)
- G-II, 3.6.3 (data formats and structures)
- G-II, 3.6.4 (Database management)
- G-II, 3.7 (Presentations of information)
- G-II, 3.7.1 (User interfaces)
- G-VII 5.4 (Claims comprising technical and non-technical features)


## Apply the Guidelines to the claim features

5. For each individual feature of claim 1 as interpreted in the light of the description, assess prima-facie whether it has technical character, referring in particular to the above EPO Guidelines and applying the COMVIK approach:

OR

5. how do these principles apply to the features of claim 1?


## Refine

6. For each individual feature which is considered to have technical character in the above assessment, go deeper in the analysis using the Guidelines and the description. Assess what is the underlying technical effect disclosed in the description or directly derivable from the claim features?

OR:
6. For each individual feature which does not have technical character in the first assessment, explain using the Guidelines, why the feature should not be regarded as technical.


## Refine further

7. Provide reasons for any feature considered non-technical, explaining why it does not contribute to the technical solution.

## Compare to prior art

8. the prior art document D1 is found in D1.pdf.
check if the file contains machine readable text. if so:
- Parse the actual text content of the uploaded file.
- Summarize the disclosure from the text content of the file.
- compare the features of claim 1 to the explicit and implicit disclosure of the document to assess novelty in the sense of the EPC. 

Walk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.

## Assess inventive step.

9. Assess inventive step using D1 as the closest prior art.
Focus in particular in:
- for each distinguishing feature, check whether the feature provides a technical effect in the context of the subject matter of claim 1 as a whole.
- if a feature does not provide a technical effect, explain why.

## Reasses the technical effects of the distinguishing features in the light of the description:

10. assess again the distinguishing features in the light of the disclosure of the description. 
check if the description provides a basis for the technical effects you identified.

## Generate inventive step assessment using features YOU, the human, already identified as differences.

11.	In summary, in my opinion:
the subject matter of claim 1 differs from the disclosure of D1 in that:
U1)	
U2)	
U3)	

assess inventive step using these features as differences over D1.

## Check arguments for the contrary conclusion. Use one of these options.

12. Could it be argued that the claim does involve an inventive step?
12. Could it be argued that the claim does NOT involve an inventive step?

## Draft:

13. draft the inventive step assessment into paragraphs that can be included into a communication.
