## Compare current claims to previous claims, determine changes and compare for basis in the description
- **Description:**  
This prompt aims to use [Patty](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67eba45560b08191a2dc76c46d82b4d3-patty) to provide an assessment of the amendments introduced with the latest claims regarding Article 123(2) EPC.
From experience, Patty has sometimes problems with the term *original claims* because it tends to think of them as some claims already provided in the conversation session.
- **Pre-requirements:**  
None!
This prompt can be used without the *"Starting prompt"* (from *"00 - Starting prompt.md"* in this folder.)
- **Documents used:**  
  - clms-orig.pdf file containing the **Claims as originally filed**;  
  - desc.pdf description containing the **Description as originally filed**;  
  - clms.txt file containing the **latest claims**.
  - If you have the claims as a .pdf or other format, or the original claims and description are part of an A1 publication, change the prompt before submitting!
    
#### Prompt:  
    **UserAction: User should upload the documents containing:  
    - the claims as originally filed;  
    - the description as originally filed;  
    - the latest claims on file.**  
    **Note: If the user has not provided all of the required documents, ask the user to upload the documents.**
    **Important: 
    - The original claims and description define the application as originally filed for the purpose of the assessment of amendments.
    - First check the original claims for basis of any amendments, then check the description.**

    - the latest claims on file are in clms.txt.  
    - the claims as originally filed are in clms-orig.pdf.  
    - the description as originally filed is in desc.pdf.  
    Check if these documents contain machine readable text.  
    If so:  
    1. Provide a complete comparison of *all* amendments made to the latest claim 1 as compared to claim 1 as originally filed. Amendments can be made by way of addition, deletion or reordering of features. 
    2. Indicate if there is a basis in the application as originally filed which directly and unambiguously discloses the identified amendments.
    3. Determine if the amendments meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC as expressed in the relevant Guidelines.
