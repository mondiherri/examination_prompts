# Analysing technical character (Art. 52(2) EPC) and Inventive Step  

- **Description:**  
This prompt sequence uses [Patty](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67eba45560b08191a2dc76c46d82b4d3-patty) to analyse technical character of an independent claim according to the Guidelines.  
The assessment of technical character is part of the assessment of Inventive step, especially in the case of computer-implemented inventions (Guidelines G-VII.5.4).  
- **Pre-requirements:**  
None!  
This sequence incorporates the *"Starting prompt"*. Skip the Prompt 1. if you have already provided the claims to Patty.
- **Documents used:**
  - .pdf or .txt file containing the **Claims** in machine readable form.
  - .pdf file containing the **Description** in machine readable form.
  - **At least one prior art** document in .pdf format, for ease of reference name them **D1.pdf**, **D2.pdf**, etc... 

## Initiate the context:  
**Make the model "understand" the claim features.**  

#### Prompt 1:  
     **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the claims.**
     **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the claims.**
	 
     Me and you are examining case EP0000001. 
     the latest claims are in:
     - clms.pdf
	    - clms.txt
     
     Check if the file contains machine readable text. 
	    If so:
	    1. Prepare a FFTP-style breakdown of the features of claim 1,  
	    presenting the Features,  
     the function(s) they achieve,  
     the technical effect(s) they bring about,  
     and the resulting problem(s) solved thereby.
     
     For a feature many technical effects and corresponding problems are possible. However, we focus only on the claim wording as is when predicting the technical effects and resulting problems, and we view the claim wording in its broadest sense which has meaning to the skilled person in the field. 

**Make the LLM "understand" the claim features in the light of the description.**   
#### Prompts 2-3:  
     **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the description.**
     **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the description.**
     
     The description can be found in  
     - desc.pdf 
     - a1.pdf, which is the original A1 publication.
     Check if the file contains machine readable text.  
     If so:
     
     2. Verify if the description provides more details regarding the claimed aspects.
     3. Reassess the feature breakdown of claim 1 in light of the disclosure of the description corresponding to each individual feature.
 
#### *Alternative step 3.*:  
     3. For each feature of claim 1, reassess technical character or lack thereof of the feature based on the disclosure of the description corresponding to each feature.
     Walk me through this context in manageable parts step by step,  
     summarizing and analyzing as we go

## Remind Patty the relevant Guidelines:  
  
**UserAction: Remove the Guidelines references that do not apply!**  
The purpose of this prompt is to make Patty retrieve and remember the relevant Guidelines for technical character under Article 52(2) EPC.  
The list is not exhaustive! 
  
#### Prompt 4:  
      4. In detail, explain what are the requirements expressed in the following Guidelines regarding technical character of claim features.  
      Do not apply these to the claim features yet.
      – G-II, 3.3 (mathematical methods, including ML),
      – G-II, 3.3.1 (machine learning),
      – G-II, 3.3.2 (simulation of systems), 
      - G-II, 3.5.1 (Schemes for performing mental acts),
      - G-II, 3.5.2 (Schemes for playing games),
      - G-II, 3.5.3 (Schemes for doing business),
      – G-II, 3.6 (computer programs),
      - G-II, 3.6.1 (examples of further technical effects)
      - G-II, 3.6.2 (Information modelling, activity of programming)
      - G-II, 3.6.3 (data formats and structures)
      - G-II, 3.6.4 (Database management)
      - G-II, 3.7 (Presentations of information)
      - G-II, 3.7.1 (User interfaces)
      - G-VII 5.4 (Claims comprising technical and non-technical features)

## Apply the retrieved Guidelines to the claim features:   
#### Prompt 5:  
      5. For each individual feature of claim 1 as interpreted in the light of the description,   
      assess prima-facie whether it has technical character,  
      referring in particular to the above EPO Guidelines and applying the COMVIK approach:
#### *Alternative step 5.*:   
      5. How do these principles apply to the features of claim 1?

## (Optional) Refine analysis  
#### Prompt 6:  
      6. For each individual feature which is considered to have technical character in the above assessment,  
      go deeper in the analysis using the Guidelines and the description.  
      Assess what is the underlying technical effect disclosed in the description or directly derivable from the claim features?

#### *Alternative step 6.*:   
      6. For each individual feature which does not have technical character in the first assessment,   
      explain using the Guidelines, why the feature should not be regarded as technical.  


## (Optional) Refine further
#### Prompt 7:  
      7. Provide reasons for any feature considered non-technical, explaining why it does not contribute to the technical solution.

## Ask for arguments to the contrary
**Ask for arguments in favor of features previously assessed as NON-technical**
These two prompts can be used one after the other, they are not exclusive.
#### Prompt 7:
      7.1. For each individual feature which does not have technical character in the first assessment, 
      what could be arguments in favor of the technical character of these features.

**Ask for arguments in favor of features previously assessed as technical**     
#### Prompt 7:
     7.2. For each individual feature which does have technical character in the first assessment, 
      what could be arguments against the technical character of these features.
      
---------------------------------------------------------------       
## Compare to prior art
#### Prompt 8:
      **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the prior art.**  
      **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the prior art document.**  
      
      8. The prior art document D1 is found in D1.pdf.
      - Check if the file contains machine readable text. 
      If so:
      - Parse the actual text content of the uploaded file.
      - Summarize the disclosure from the text content of the file.
      - Compare the features of claim 1 to the explicit and implicit disclosure of the document to assess Novelty in the sense of the EPC. 

## Assess inventive step.  
#### Prompt 9:  
      9. Assess inventive step using D1 as the closest prior art.
      Focus in particular in:
      - for each distinguishing feature, check whether the feature provides a technical effect in the context of the subject matter of claim 1 as a whole.
      - if a feature does not provide a technical effect, explain why.

### Reasses the technical effects of the distinguishing features in the light of the description:
#### Prompt 10:  
      10. Assess again the distinguishing features in the light of the disclosure of the description. 
      Check if the description provides a basis for the technical effects you identified previously.

### (Optional) Generate inventive step assessment using features YOU, the human, already identified as differences.
**If you are not satisfied with the novelty assessment and have made your own, provide the distinguishing features that you have identified in order to proceed with the inventive step assessment.**
#### Prompt 11:  
      **UserAction: User should provide a list of distinguishing features that they have identified.**
      **Note: if the user has not provided any distinguishing features, ask the user to provide them.**   
      
      11.	In summary, in my opinion:
      The subject matter of claim 1 differs from the disclosure of D1 in that:
      U1)	
      U2)	
      U3)	

      Assess inventive step using these features as differences over D1.

## Check arguments for the contrary conclusion. Use one of these options.
#### Prompt 12, Inventive:  
      12. Could it be argued that the claim does involve an inventive step?
#### Prompt 12, NOT Inventive:     
      12. Could it be argued that the claim does NOT involve an inventive step?

## Draft communication or letter:  
#### Prompt 13:  
      13. Draft the inventive step assessment into paragraphs that can be included into a communication.
