# Analysing Inventive Step
- **Description:**  
This prompt sequence is intended to use [Patty](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67eba45560b08191a2dc76c46d82b4d3-patty) to inventive step of an independent claim according to the Guidelines.  
No assessment of technical character is involved by this claim, so do not expect Patty to deal with technical character!
- **Pre-requirements:**  
None!  
This sequence incorporates the *"Starting prompt"*. Skip the Prompt 1. if you have already provided the claims to Patty.
- **Documents used:**
  - .pdf or .txt file containing the **Claims** in machine readable form.
  - .pdf file containing the **Description** in machine readable form.
  - **At least one prior art** document in .pdf format, for ease of reference name them **D1.pdf**, **D2.pdf**, etc... 


#### Prompt 1:  
The text of the claims is pasted in the textbox.
    **UserAction: User should paste the text of the claims.**
    **Note: if the user has not provided any claim text, ask the user to paste the claims in the textbox.**  

    Me and you are examining case EP0000001.  
    The literal text of claim 1 is:
    
    > User, paste literal text of claim!

##### Alternative Prompt 1:
The claims are provided as document.  

    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the claims.**
    **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the claims.**
    Me and you are examining case EP0000001. 
    The latest claims are in:
    - clms.pdf
	  - clms.txt
     
    Check if the file contains machine readable text. 
	  If so:
	  1. Prepare a FFTP-style breakdown of the features of claim 1,  
	  presenting the Features,  
    the function(s) they achieve,  
    the technical effect(s) they bring about,  
    and the resulting problem(s) solved thereby.

### (Optional) Interpret the claim features in the light of the description:  

#### Prompt 1.1:  
     **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the description.**  
	 **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the description.**   
	 
	 The description can be found in :
	 - desc.pdf 
	 - a1.pdf, which is the original A1 publication.
	 
	 Check if the file contains machine readable text.  
     If so:  
	 1.1. Verify if the description provides more details regarding the claimed aspects.
	 1.2. Reassess the feature breakdown of claim 1 in light of the disclosure of the description corresponding to each individual feature of the claim.


#### Prompt 2: 
Make a first assessment of inventive step, that you can refine later.  

    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the prior art.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the prior art document.**  
     
    2. make a full inventive step assessment of claim 1 over the provided prior art documents.

#### Conservative prompt 2:  
    2. Assess inventive step  over the prior art.  
	Be conservative, if an effect is not derivable from the claim features alone, then it is not there.

### Review and Reformat the feature mapping
#### Prompt 3:      
Reformat the feature mapping! Change the example given below to your style.

    - provide a feature mapping of the literal text of claim 1 features to corresponding text passages or paragraphs of D1, disclosing the corresponding claim features.
    - use the following format as an example for the feature mapping:
     *Example*:
     F1) literal text of feature
     (see D1, passage 1, passage 2;
     explanation of disclosure of D1)
     F2) literal text of feature
     (not disclosed in D1) **If a feature is not disclosed, indicate it like this**
     F3) literal text of feature
     (see D1, passage 3; passage 4)
     F4) ...

### Refine the inventive step assessment
#### Prompt 4:  
    - list again the distinguishing features of claim 1 over the closest prior art you selected.   
    - explain the technical effects of the distinguishing features.   
    - formulate an objective technical problem solved by these features.   
    - explain why the distinguishing features solve the objective technical problem.   

### Review and check for arguments for the contrary conclusion. 
**Use one of these options.**  
### Prompt 5:  
    Could it be argued that the claim does involve an inventive step?

    
#### Alternative prompt 5:
    Could it be argued that the claim does NOT involve an inventive step?  

	
### Review arguments  
### Prompt 6.1:  
Arguments from the applicant  

    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the arguments.**
    **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the arguments.**    
    The arguments of the applicant are in the file:  
	- args.pdf    
    Check if the file contains machine readable text:  
    If so:  
    - summarize each of their arguments on inventive step.  
    - draft a response to each of their arguments.  

### Prompt 6.2:  
Assessment from the examiner  

    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the assessment of the examiner.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the assessment of the examiner.**    
    The assessment of the examiner is in the file:  
	- comm.pdf  
    Check if the file contains machine readable text:  
    If so:  
    - summarize each of their arguments on inventive step.  
    - draft a response to each of their arguments.
