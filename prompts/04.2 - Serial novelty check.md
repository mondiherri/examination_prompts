# Assessing novelty for a sequence of documents
- **Description:**
  The purpose of these prompts is to use [Patty](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67eba45560b08191a2dc76c46d82b4d3-patty) to assess novelty of the claimed subject matter over a single prior art document provided as pdf (e.g. D1.pdf)
  I have included also an attempt at formatting a draft response.
- **Documents used:**    
  - (Optional) .pdf or .txt file containing the **Claims** in machine readable form.
  - **At least one prior art** document in .pdf format, for ease of reference name them **D1.pdf**, **D2.pdf**, etc...

### Novelty over first prior art
**Note: The claims are uploaded as a document.**    

#### Prompt 1:  
    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the claims and a document containing the prior art.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the necessary documents.**    

    Me and you are examining case EP123456789.
    The latest claims are in clms.pdf (or clms.txt)
    check if the file contains machine readable text. 
    If so:
    1. Prepare a FFTP-style breakdown of the features of claim 1, presenting the Features, the function(s) they achieve, the technical effect(s) they bring about, and the resulting problem(s) solved thereby.

#### Prompt 2:      
    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the prior art.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any prior art document, ask the user to upload the necessary document.**  
    
    D1 from D1.pdf, is a prior art document.   
    Check if the uploaded documents contain machine readable text.  
    If so:  
    2. Briefly Summarize the content of this document.
    3. Assess novelty of the claim 1 from the claims over D1.  

### Assess novelty of the claim over further documents (Max 4 documents)
**In a loop for up to 5 documents: One prompt submission per document.**  
**Important!  
After 5 prior art documents, Patty gets confused. Start new chat session if you need comparison with more documents!**  

#### Prompt 3:  
    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the prior art.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any prior art document, ask the user to upload the necessary document.**  
     
    4. do the same for this prior art document!

#### *Alternative Prompt 3*:
    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the prior art.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any prior art document, ask the user to upload the necessary document.**    
    
    Dx, Dx.pdf, is a prior art document.   
    Check if the uploaded document contains machine readable text.  
    If so:  
    - Assess novelty of the claim 1 from the claims over this document.   

      
**end of loop**

### Rank documents
Rank the prior art documents by relevance.

#### Prompt 4: 
    5. Please rank these prior art documents by their disclosure compared to claim 1. The more a document discloses of claim 1, the higher the rank!

### Do a feature mapping for a particular prior art document (e.g. the closest prior art)   
#### Prompt 4:   
    6. Provide a feature mapping of claim 1 to the relevant disclosure in passages of document Dx.
