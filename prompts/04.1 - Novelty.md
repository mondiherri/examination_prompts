# Assessing novelty
- **Description:**
  The purpose of these prompts is to use [Patty](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67eba45560b08191a2dc76c46d82b4d3-patty) to assess novelty of the claimed subject matter over a single prior art document provided as pdf (e.g. D1.pdf)
  I have included also an attempt at formatting a draft response.
- **Documents used:**    
  - (Optional) .pdf or .txt file containing the **Claims** in machine readable form.
  - **At least one prior art** document in .pdf format, for ease of reference name them **D1.pdf**, **D2.pdf**, etc...

Skip the Prompt 1. if you have already provided the claims to Patty.
