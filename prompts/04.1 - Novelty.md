# Assessing novelty
- **Description:**
  The purpose of these prompts is to use [Patty](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67eba45560b08191a2dc76c46d82b4d3-patty) to assess novelty of the claimed subject matter over a single prior art document provided as pdf (e.g. D1.pdf)
  I have included also an attempt at formatting a draft response.
- **Documents used:**    
  - (Optional) .pdf or .txt file containing the **Claims** in machine readable form.
  - **At least one prior art** document in .pdf format, for ease of reference name them **D1.pdf**, **D2.pdf**, etc...
 
### Alternative 1:
The claims are pasted as text.  

#### Prompt:  
    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the prior art.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the prior art document.**    
  
    D1, D1.pdf, is a prior art document.
    Check if the uploaded document contains machine readable text.
    If so:
    - Assess novelty of the following claim 1 over D1.
      
    The literal text of claim 1 is:
      
    >User, paste literal text of claim.

### Alternative 2:
The claims are uploaded as a document.  

#### Prompt:  
    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the claims and a document containing the prior art.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any document, ask the user to upload the necessary documents.**    
   
    The latest claims are in clms.pdf (or clms.txt)  
    D1, D1.pdf, is a prior art document.   
    Check if the uploaded documents contain machine readable text.  
    If so:  
    - Assess novelty of the claim 1 from the claims over D1.  

### Follow up to Alternative 2 - Consider general knowledge for implicit disclosure

#### Prompt:  
The user should refine the definition of the field for better focus of the LLM on the relevant field.
 
    Compare again claim 1 to D1. Consider the general knowledge of the skilled person in the technical field of the claim.

### (Optional) Assess novelty for another prior art pdf document, e.g. D2.pdf
***Important!  
Stop the conversation after 5 prior art documents in total. Patty starts getting confused at the 6th prior art document***  
#### Prompt:
    **UserAction: User should upload a document containing the prior art.**  
    **Note: if the user has not provided any prior art document, ask the user to upload the necessary document.**  
     
    Dx, Dx.pdf, is a prior art document.   
    Check if the uploaded document contains machine readable text.  
    If so:  
    - Assess novelty of the claim 1 from the claims over this document.

### Draft the assessment in a certain format  

#### Prompt:
    Make a novelty assessment of claim 1 over D1, by:
    Step by step by step:
    - provide a feature mapping of the literal text of claim 1 features to corresponding text passages or paragraphs of D1.
    - use the following format for feature mapping:
      F1) literal text of feature
      (see D1, passage 1, passage 2;
      explanation of disclosure of D1)
      F2) literal text of feature
      (not disclosed in D1) **If a feature is not disclosed, indicate it like this**
      F3) literal text of feature
      (see D1, passage 3; passage 4)
      F4) ...

#### *Alternative Prompt:*   
   
    Provide a feature mapping of claim 1 to the relevant disclosure in passages of document Dx.
